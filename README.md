# Project Austerlitz

# MD&A Shell Maker
This is a script that prepares the sections in which results of operations are read, where cash flows are discussed and where critical accounting policies are declared. 

# How To Use
To use it the script, you must have a valid TeX distribution. If you do not have one, you may download one [here](https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html). A word version can be made available upon request. You must save the script to the same folder as the folder in which you have saved the excel file that holds the data you are reading. You'll need to modify the script to indicate the sheet numbers as appropriate. For convenience, I've marked the places in the script where you'll need to make these edits.
