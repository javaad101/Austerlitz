# MD&A Shell Maker
This is a script that prepares shell recitations used in first drafts of MD&As. That is, it prepares the section in which results of operations are read. To use it, you must have a valid TeX distribution. If you do not have one, you may download one [here](https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html).
